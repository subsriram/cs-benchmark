"""SWE-bench Verified harness driver (issue #29a).

For each (task, arm) pair:

1. Shallow-clones the task repo at ``base_commit`` into a tempdir
2. Materializes a per-arm MCP config (substitutes @CODESURGEON_MCP_BIN@ and
   @CS_WORKSPACE@ in ``mcp_with.json`` / passes ``mcp_without.json`` as-is)
3. Runs ``claude --print --output-format json --strict-mcp-config …`` against
   the checkout with the task's ``problem_statement`` as the prompt
4. Captures: resolved diff (``git diff``), token usage (from JSON output),
   walltime, claude exit code, arm tag, instance id
5. Appends one JSONL record per (task, arm) to ``target/swebench/results.jsonl``

This script only produces agent patches. It does **not** evaluate them against
the swebench test harness — that is deferred to #29b via
``scripts/swebench_report.py`` which invokes ``swebench.harness.run_evaluation``
on the collected diffs.

Usage:
    uv run benches/swebench/run.py --dry-run              # wiring smoke test
    uv run benches/swebench/run.py --tasks 1              # run 1 task x 2 arms
    uv run benches/swebench/run.py --tasks 10 --arms with # just the treatment
    uv run benches/swebench/run.py                        # full 100 x 2

# codesurgeon MCP tools — consult before exploring

This repository is indexed by codesurgeon. Before using Read or Grep to
explore the codebase, use these MCP tools to get targeted context:

| Tool | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `mcp__cs-codesurgeon__run_pipeline` | **First call on any task**. Returns a budgeted capsule of relevant symbols with full source plus call-graph edges. Pass both `task` (short description) and `context` (raw problem statement, verbatim, unmodified). |
| `mcp__cs-codesurgeon__get_impact_graph` | Walks callers / importers / raisers of a symbol. Use when the first capsule named the symptom (an exception class, a public API) but didn't include the function that needs changing. See the chaining note below. |
| `mcp__cs-codesurgeon__get_skeleton` | File API surface without bodies. 70–90% fewer tokens than reading the full file. |
| `mcp__cs-codesurgeon__save_observation` | Persist an insight tied to a symbol for future sessions. |

## Why pass `context` on `run_pipeline`

`task` is the agent's summary; `context` is the raw source the summary was
derived from. Identifiers (function names, class names, dotted API calls)
that you might paraphrase out of `task` are recovered from `context` via
server-side symbol-anchor extraction. BM25, semantic search, and intent
detection still run on `task` alone, so `context` has no effect on query
budget — only on anchor resolution.

## Chain `run_pipeline` → `get_impact_graph` when the bug site is unnamed

Bug reports usually describe symptoms — *"I get `PolynomialError` when I call
`subs()` on a `Piecewise`"* — while the actual fix site is a function that
**raises** or **catches** the error, and that function is almost never named
in the report. `run_pipeline` anchors on the identifiers the user DID
mention (the exception class, the triggering API); the fix site won't be
in the capsule because nothing textually anchors to it.

**Workflow when the first capsule doesn't include an obviously-fixable
symbol**:

1. Pick the most specific identifier from the capsule — typically the
   exception class (e.g. `PolynomialError`) or the user-facing method
   (e.g. `Piecewise`).
2. Call `get_impact_graph` on that symbol's FQN. It returns every function
   that raises it, catches it, or transitively calls a raiser.
3. Scan the dependents for a function name that matches the symptom domain
   (for a `subs()`-related crash, look for `eval`, `doit`, `_eval_subs`, or
   the class named in the triggering call).
4. Open that function with Read — it will usually be the fix site.

This two-call chain typically replaces 10–20 exploratory Grep/Read calls.
If you skip it and default to Grep on the exception name, you'll walk the
same call graph manually and burn tokens.

    Critical design choice — why the disposable workspace:
      A previous version pointed preflight at the actual task workspace

        - The server's main stdio loop exits on EOF
        - The server's background-indexing thread does not — it keeps

          subprocess.run returns
        - Subsequent ``claude --print`` launches a second MCP against
          the same workspace, which contends with the zombie over SQLite
          and falls into secondary mode where tools aren't eagerly
          advertised at init
        - Agent's init event shows ``mcp_servers: []`` — the exact
          failure preflight was supposed to prevent

    """Spawn ``codesurgeon-mcp`` against ``workspace`` as a primary daemon,
    wait for its engine to be ready, then leave it running.

    When ``claude --print`` later spawns its own MCP via ``--mcp-config``,
    the sidecar already holds the PID lock (``.codesurgeon/mcp.pid``).
    Claude's process falls into the server's "secondary mode" branch in
    ``cs-mcp::main`` — secondary mode runs ``CoreEngine::new`` synchronously
    (``without_embedder()``, so it's fast) and populates ``cell`` before
    starting the stdio loop. That eliminates the race where the first
    ``tools/call run_pipeline`` arrives before the engine is ready and
    returns the ``⏳ Engine still initializing`` placeholder.

    TODO (post-2.1.119 update): the sidecar was added to dodge an
    initialize-vs-engine-ready race observed on 2.1.117. If 2.1.119
    serialises ``initialize`` against engine readiness internally (or
    if the race never manifested on 2.1.119 to begin with), the
    sidecar is dead weight — costs ~0.2-1.4 s per run and one extra
    PID-lock holder. To measure: run with the sidecar code path
    bypassed (early-return ``(None, "sidecar disabled")``) and confirm
    no ``⏳ Engine still initializing`` placeholders in the first
    ``tools/call run_pipeline`` result across n=3 runs. If clean,
    drop the sidecar or gate it behind ``--use-sidecar`` (default off
    on 2.1.119+).

    Returns ``(Popen, message)``. Returns ``(None, err_msg)`` if the
    sidecar failed to reach engine-ready within ``ready_timeout_s``; the
    caller should abort the run in that case. On success, the caller is
    responsible for killing the Popen in a ``finally`` block after
    ``claude --print`` returns.

    Why a primary-mode sidecar (not two secondaries):
      - Only the primary does background indexing. A schema-mismatched
        workspace still gets re-indexed in the background while claude's
        secondary serves warm from SQLite — behaviour unchanged from today.
      - Secondary mode is synchronous + embedder-skipping, so it's fast
        exactly when we need it (during the agent's first tool call).
